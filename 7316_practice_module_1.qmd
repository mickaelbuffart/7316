# MODULE 1: Getting used to R

During the first module, we tried to get used to the R environment and tools, and load data. To get ready for the second module, **before the next class:**

1. Set up the R environment on your laptop and set up your global settings as you see fit. Explore the options and interface.

2. Go through this material again, install the required packages, and try to load and save your own data.

3. Read the outline of Module 2.
